# Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-08-16

---

## 1. Unprotected Admin API Endpoints

*   **Status:** Secure
*   **Evidence:** The application is a pure frontend application and does not have its own API endpoints that would require protection. It only consumes the Formspree service for form submissions.
*   **Recommended Mitigation:** N/A

---

## 2. Leaked Admin Logic in the Client

*   **Status:** Secure
*   **Evidence:** A thorough search for keywords such as `admin`, `role`, and `isAdmin` did not reveal any administrative logic in the client-side code. The occurrences of the word `role` are related to ARIA attributes for accessibility, which is a recommended practice.
*   **Recommended Mitigation:** N/A

---

## 3. Users Accessing Others' Resources

*   **Status:** Not Applicable / Secure
*   **Evidence:** The application does not have a user authentication system. The application's state, including booked times, is stored in the browser's `localStorage`. This means that one user's booking data is not visible to others, as `localStorage` is specific to each user and browser.
*   **Recommended Mitigation:** N/A. If a backend system were implemented, it would be crucial to ensure that an authenticated user could not view or modify other users' bookings.

---

## 4. Leaked Secrets in Frontend

*   **Status:** Mitigated
*   **Evidence:** The Formspree form ID `xrbknnjr` was hardcoded directly in the [`src/components/BookingTable.tsx`](src/components/BookingTable.tsx) component.
*   **Mitigation Implemented:** The ID has been moved to a `.env` file and is accessed via `import.meta.env.VITE_FORMSPREE_ID`. The `.env` file has been added to the `.gitignore` to prevent it from being included in the repository.

---

## 5. Users Updating Protected Properties

*   **Status:** Secure
*   **Evidence:** The application does not have user data or protected properties (such as `isAdmin`). The form only submits the information necessary for booking through Formspree. There is no way for a user to modify their "access level" or other protected fields.
*   **Recommended Mitigation:** N/A

---

## 6. Exposed Sitemaps/Endpoint Lists

*   **Status:** Secure
*   **Evidence:** A search for `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` found no files. The application does not expose a list of routes or endpoints.
*   **Recommended Mitigation:** N/A

---

## 7. Improper Row-Level Security (RLS)

*   **Status:** Not Applicable
*   **Evidence:** The application does not use a backend like Supabase or Firebase, so row-level security (RLS) does not apply.
*   **Recommended Mitigation:** N/A

---

## 8. Returning Unnecessary Data

*   **Status:** Secure
*   **Evidence:** The application does not have API endpoints that return data. The only external communication is with Formspree, to which the frontend sends only the data necessary for booking.
*   **Recommended Mitigation:** N/A

---

## 9. Use of Incremented IDs

*   **Status:** Secure
*   **Evidence:** The services in the [`src/components/BookingTable.tsx`](src/components/BookingTable.tsx) component use sequential numeric IDs (1, 2, 3). However, these IDs are only used on the client-side to manage the selection state and are not exposed in the URL or used to access resources. The application's routes, defined in [`src/App.tsx`](src/App.tsx), are static and do not include dynamic parameters.
*   **Recommended Mitigation:** N/A. If the IDs were used in URLs (e.g., `/services/1`), it would be recommended to replace them with UUIDs to prevent resource enumeration.

---

## 10. Vulnerability to Google Dorks

*   **Status:** Mitigated
*   **Evidence:** A search for potentially sensitive files found the `.env` file and a Codacy log file.
*   **Mitigation Implemented:** The `.env` file and the `.codacy` directory have been added to the `.gitignore` file to ensure they are not included in the repository.
